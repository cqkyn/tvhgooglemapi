### TVHGoogleMapi

When you move to gmail or google apps you can no longer use the build in 'send to mail recipient as attachment' menu option of MS Office and other windows applications without installing a local mail client. The Right click menu of files in explorer Send To -> Mail recipient doesn't work either. Tvhgooglemapi is a simple tool that pretends to be a real mail client to windows but really only uploads the mail to the drafts folder of gmail and then opens the draft in the default webbrowser. For the user this is almost exactly the same as having the gmail web interface as the default mailclient for some windows applications (the only difference being that he has to login twice if he is not already logged in to gmail and doesn't let the tool remember the password.)

### Also usefull
Users of this tool will typically want (but do not have) to complement it with google chrome (which can handle mailto links in windows) or something like http://dl.google.com/tag/s/ap=google.com/googlewebapps/en/googleappsstandalonesetuptagged.exe

By default tvhgooglemapi will open the draft in a new browser tab/window. If you are using Google Chrome there is an extension that makes sure that only one tab for gmail is open (and also only one for google calendar,...) Using this extension will cause the draft to be opened in the tab where you had gmail open, some people may find that desireable. You can find it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-fixer-for-google-apps/cplbkecindmpapmnffepmnbiogpllcni/details It's support page is here: https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-tab-fixer/wiki/FAQ

### Support and feedback
There is no formal support plan, warranty or guarantee the application will work in your environment, but if you do run into issues and we can find some time we may be able to help. As always, test it out in a non critical environment first and sent your first mails to a test address (ie not to customers) to verify everything is working fine. For feedback or questions you may contact jan dot keirse at tvh dot com, but for bug reports please use the issue tracker: https://code.google.com/p/tvhgooglemapi/issues/list

### Request for help
I'm looking for a Windows C/C++ developer who can get the DLL to handle international encodings (unicode) properly. This is probably very very easy for someone who's used to working in C/C++ with Visual Studio but I don't have time to look into this myself. Please get in touch or respond to https://code.google.com/p/tvhgooglemapi/issues/detail?id=2 if you can help.
